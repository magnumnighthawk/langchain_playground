# LangChain Food Tips Generator

A simple Python application that generates food tips using LangChain and OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model.

## Description

This project demonstrates the basic usage of LangChain to create a chain that generates customized food tips based on sentiment and keyword inputs. It uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo-instruct model to generate human-like responses.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- OpenAI API key

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install langchain langchain-community openai
```

3. Set up your OpenAI API key:
   - Replace `"your_api_key_here"` in `chain.py` with your actual OpenAI API key
   - Alternatively, set it as an environment variable:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key'
```

## Usage

Run the script using Python:

```bash
python chain.py
```

You can modify the `sentiment` and `keyword` parameters in the code to generate different types of tips:

```python
response = chain.run({'sentiment': "great", 'keyword': "food"})
```

## Example Output

The program will generate tips based on the provided sentiment and keyword. For example:
```
"Here's a great food tip: Always try to eat a rainbow of colors on your plate for maximum nutritional benefits!"
```

## Features

- Customizable prompt template
- Adjustable temperature for response creativity
- Simple and easy to modify for different use cases
